## 1. Introduction  
This document provides a high-level overview of all agents inside the Samarkand Soul MAMOS ecosystem.  
Each agent is a specialized operational unit with a clear mission, defined limits, escalation rules, and command hierarchy.

Agents work together under one unified identity, one brand philosophy, and one long-term vision.

This document acts as the **master map** for all PART C files.

## 2. Agent Families  
All Samarkand Soul agents belong to four primary families:

### 2.1 DS — Digital Sales Agents  
These agents directly generate revenue.  
They handle research, ads, creatives, pricing, product pages, email-SMS, funnels, store structure, KPI analytics, and more.

Focus:  
- Market understanding  
- Creative production  
- Offer creation  
- Ads and distribution  
- Store optimization  
- Scaling

### 2.2 LIFE Agents  
These agents protect the founder’s energy, health, time, and long-term decision quality.

Focus:  
- Health  
- Nutrition  
- Fitness  
- Time architecture  
- Information management  

Samarkand Soul can only scale if the founder is optimized.

### 2.3 SYS Agents  
Infrastructure guardians.  
They ensure stability, documentation, security, and long-term scalability.

Focus:  
- Knowledge curation  
- SOP creation  
- System health  
- Security  
- Roadmap architecture  

These are the “silent backbone” of the brand.

### 2.4 Operational Command (OP)  
These agents enforce discipline, escalation rules, and operational safety.

Focus:  
- Workflow enforcement  
- Failure recovery  
- Escalation layers  
- Automation tracking

## 3. Agent Chain of Command  
The entire agent ecosystem follows a strict command structure:

1. **Commander (Human – Zahid Brat)**  
   - Final authority  
   - Approves high-risk / brand-critical actions  

2. **SYS Agents (Architects & Librarians)**  
   - Maintain structure  
   - Approve SOPs  
   - Protect knowledge  

3. **DS Agents (Sales Engine)**  
   - Execute daily business operations  
   - Generate revenue  

4. **LIFE Agents (Human System Protectors)**  
   - Maintain long-term stability  

5. **OP Agents (Discipline & Safety)**  
   - Ensure compliance  
   - Stop operations on risk  

---

## 4. Agent Behavior Rules  
All agents must follow:

- Brand Philosophy (A1)  
- Human + AI Principle (A2)  
- Long-Term Vision (A3)  
- System Architecture (B1)  
- Compliance Rules (B2)

### Core Behavioural Expectations:
- No hallucinations  
- No speculation  
- No fake data  
- No exaggerated claims  
- No cultural violations  
- No brand tone violations  

If unsure → **ESCALATE**.

---

## 5. Escalation Protocol  
All agents must escalate when:

- Data is missing  
- A request creates conflict with brand identity  
- A decision affects long-term vision  
- Legal, ethical, or cultural uncertainty arises  
- High-risk actions are detected  

Escalation Levels:
1. Pause output  
2. Send escalation message  
3. Request Commander review  

No agent continues after risk is detected.
