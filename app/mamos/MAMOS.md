# MAMOS — Samarkand Soul Unified Brain  
**Mission · Architecture · Mindset · Operations · Spirit**

This document is the **core brain** of the entire Samarkand Soul ecosystem.  
Every agent, integration, service, and script must operate according to the principles defined here.

If an agent does not understand the mission — it cannot act correctly.  
If a module contradicts the brand — it must be rejected.

MAMOS is the law, the compass, the philosophy, and the long-term memory.
